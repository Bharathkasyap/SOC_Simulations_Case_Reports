# Alert 4: Inbound Email Containing Suspicious External Link Clicked by User


## üìò Scenario Explanation:
This alert was triggered when an inbound phishing email reached the user‚Äôs mailbox, crafted to appear as a security notification from Microsoft. The sender used a typo-squatted domain (`m1crosoftsupport.co`) to impersonate Microsoft and included a malicious link urging the user to ‚ÄúReview Activity.‚Äù

Upon review of the **firewall logs**, it was observed that the internal user device (`10.20.2.25`) made an outbound HTTPS connection to the phishing domain (`45.148.10.131`), confirming that the link was clicked. Although the phishing site currently returns a DNS resolution failure, this does not negate the threat it posed at the time of delivery.

## üîç Online Tool Analysis:

### ‚úÖ VirusTotal:
- Result: **0/97 vendors flagged the domain** as malicious.
- However, the domain was registered in a suspicious pattern (`m1crosoftsupport.co`) clearly intended to mimic Microsoft.
- Link used: `https://m1crosoftsupport.co/login`

### ‚úÖ AnyRun Sandbox:
- URL rendered unreachable.
- Confirmed that the domain could not serve a payload.
- However, the infrastructure used appears to have been **dismantled or expired**, which often happens **post-campaign**.

## üß™ Splunk Log-Based Confirmation of User Click
After reviewing the logs collected via Splunk, it was confirmed that the inbound phishing email containing the suspicious domain https://m1crosoftsupport.co/login was successfully delivered to the user's inbox at 01:17:23 UTC. Shortly thereafter, at 01:18:32 UTC, firewall logs captured via Splunk showed that the same user device (10.20.2.25) initiated an outbound HTTPS connection to the phishing domain.

This timeline clearly demonstrates that the user clicked on the embedded phishing link, resulting in successful network communication with the external site. Although the phishing domain was later found to be inactive through external sandbox and reputation tools, the user interaction with the infrastructure is an indication of real exposure.

This behavior meets the threshold for a True Positive classification and warrants escalation, as user credentials may have been compromised during the short window when the phishing domain was accessible.

</table>

## ‚úÖ Reason for Classifying as True Positive:
- The domain `m1crosoftsupport.co` is a **malicious impersonation** of Microsoft using typo-squatting.
- The email employed **urgency-based social engineering** to encourage user action.
- **Firewall logs confirmed** that the user clicked the link and traffic to the phishing domain was allowed.
- Despite the domain appearing inactive now, it was likely part of a **live phishing infrastructure** when accessed.
- The attack was **not simulated or internally generated**, indicating a real threat.

---


## üö® Reason for Escalating the Alert:
- User interaction with a phishing link means **potential credential compromise**.
- Immediate escalation ensures containment, password reset, and follow-up investigation.
- Even if the phishing page is inactive now, it could have logged credentials when the user accessed it.
- Escalating allows us to:
  - Investigate user‚Äôs device
  - Block associated domains and IPs
  - Launch awareness campaigns for similar spoofing attempts
  - Perform a broader tenant-wide search

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Remediation Actions:
- **Reset credentials** for user c.allen@thetrydaily.thm immediately.
- Conduct a **forensic investigation** on the user‚Äôs device (`10.20.2.25`) for malware traces.
- Block domain `m1crosoftsupport.co` and IP `45.148.10.131` at the firewall and proxy layers.
- Conduct a **tenant-wide search** for other emails from the same spoofed domain.
- Educate the user on **phishing awareness**, especially impersonation and typo-squatting tactics.
- Create alerting rules in SIEM for **known impersonation domains** and suspicious URL clicks.
